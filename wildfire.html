            The association between circulation anomalies in the mid-troposphere and area burned by wildland fire in Canada (1998, W.R Skinner) </a></li>

            <ul>
              <li> A stronger than normal ridge over western North America often produces abnormally warm and dry conditions.
                <ol>
                  <li> 500hpa circulation is more meridional than normal </li>
                  <li> the jet stream is displaced </li>
                  <li> moisture-bearing systems are deflected </li>
                  <li> high pressure subsidence with surface evaporation and dry conditions </li>
                </ol>
              <li> The fire season over much of Canada is when higher temperatures and thunderstorms with lightning strikes occur most frequently. </li>

       <! 3rd paper >
       <li> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969700005246">
            Climate change and forest fires (2000, M.D Flannigan) </a></li>

            <ul>
              <li> weather conditions that influence fuel moisture : temperature, precipitation, wind speed, atmospheric moisture </li>
              <li> Individual fire is a result of the complex set of interactions that include ignition agents, fuel condidtions,
              topography and weather including temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and the amount and frequency of
              precipitation. Increasing temperature alone does not necessarily guarantee greater fire disturbance. </li>

              Climate change and forest fire potential in Russian and Canadian boreal forests (1998, B.J.Stocks) </a></li>

                   <ul>
                     <li> Large increases in the areal extent of extreme fire danger in Russia and Canada under a 2 x CO2 climate scenario. </li>
